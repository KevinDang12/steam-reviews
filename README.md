# Steam Review Summarizer
A Steam review summarizer that fetches recent reviews from Steam.

The recent reviews are fed to the OpenAI to process and generate a summary of the reviews.

It allows users to sign in with Google to create and save their notes to the backend server.

The Steam review Summarizer web app is hosted on Firebase. It can be accessed [here](https://steamreviewsummarizer.com/).
